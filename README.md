Build log for dactyl-manuform

## Research

First step is to figure out what design to go for. I have the following requirements:
* 60% keyboard - I want to have a number row since I think that will be useful for vim
* Thumb pain - I want to avoid the pain I get from my planck when reaching for alt and second layer keys.
* More layers - I want to have more layers than the planck, so I can have more keys available for macros and other things.

I found the [dactyl-generator-demo](https://github.com/yejianfengblue/dactyl-generator-demo) which comes with good documentation.
We will start there and try to build a keyboard that meets my requirements. Hopefully without having to do any programming.

## Manuform v1

I went with a pretty basic manuform without number keys for prototyping. I skipped a thumb key and moved the thumb cluster outwards to
make it fit better for my hands.
